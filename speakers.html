      Abstract:
    </b>
  </p>
  <p>
  Artificial Intelligence in radiology is going through a boom right now. But it represents just the latest iteration of decades of research in computer-aided detection and diagnosis. In this presentation, I will describe some recent developments in AI for radiology, including advances in automated detection and image segmentation. I will then present some use cases of AI in radiology and describe lessons learned and remaining gaps in knowledge.

  <h4>
    Proton radiobiology and imaging: challenges and opportunities
  </h4>
  <p>
    <b>
      Abstract
    </b>
  </p>
  <p>
    High energy proton therapy has revolutionised the treatment of certain tumours, especially amongst paediatric cases. Since 2018, it has been available in the UK. In this talk I will give a brief introduction to proton therapy before focussing on two specific areas: clinical radiobiology and advanced imaging. We’ll discuss the differences in radiobiology between photons and protons and various approaches to deal with this. With regards to imaging, we’ll consider pre-treatment options to reduce range uncertainty, plus in-room guidance and follow-up imaging.

    Dr Tracy Underwood graduated with a Bachelors in Physics from the University of Oxford and an MSc in Medical Engineering and Physics from King's College London. She then completed a DPhil on the dosimetry of small photon beams at the Oxford Institute for Radiation Oncology. The key paper from her DPhil research has been downloaded over 12,000 times and prompted PTW to prototype a new detector: the 'DiodeAir’. She received an MRC Centenary Early Career (‘transition to postdoc’) Award and was the 2015 winner of the IET/IMechE prize for the Best Medical Engineering PhD. Funding from the Leverhulme Trust enabled her to pursue post-doctoral research (again on photon dosimetry) in Toulouse, before an EU Marie Curie Fellowship (on proton therapy) took her to Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, followed by University College London.
  </p>
  <p>
    Since September 2018 Dr Underwood has been a Dean’s Prize Research Fellow in the proton therapy group at the University of Manchester. Her primary research interests are proton radiobiology and advanced MR imaging for radiotherapy.

    Dr Isabel Dregely
  </h3>
  <p>
    Isabel Dregely is a lecturer in MRI Physics in BMEIS. Her research interest is in using imaging to improve diagnosis and therapy planning in cancer patients. She uses computer simulations, an understanding of MRI signal models and interaction in healthy and cancer tissue to efficiently acquire and accurately extract ‘functional’ information from imaging data to better characterize each patient’s cancer.
  </p>
  <p>
    Before joining King’s in 2015, she studied physics in Germany, and held research posts in USA (University of New Hampshire, Harvard, University of Virginia and University of California Los Angeles) and Germany (Technical University Munich) in many aspects of MRI research: instrumentation (designing and building RF coils), MR physics, image acquisition including pulse programming, reconstruction, quantitative and multi-parametric post-processing, novel contrast agents (hyperpolarised Xenon) and physiological modelling. As a post-doc in Munich, she worked with the worldwide first installed human whole-body simultaneous PET/MR machine.

    Malene is a medical doctor and nuclear medicine specialist. The common thread of her research is the exploration and implementation of hybrid imaging, PET/CT and PET/MR, in diagnosing and treatment of patients with cancer, literally from lab to bed-side including cost-effectiveness analysis. Malene obtained her PhD from the University of Copenhagen exploring the detection limit of the PET/CT technology as well as pioneer clinical studies on PET/CT in staging and therapy evaluation of patients with small cell lung cancer. Her Doctorate (DMSci, an old-fashioned Danish academic degree) was based on the world’s first randomized clinical trial on PET/CT in staging of patients with non-small cell lung cancer. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Although based at KCL Malene is PI of a Danish national randomized trial exploring the value of PET/CT and liquid biopsies for surveillance of patients with lung cancer.
